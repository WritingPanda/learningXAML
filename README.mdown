# Just a Panda Learning some XAML

I am learning XAML and C# for work, and I thought it would be a good exercise to build a table with row details seen once selected.

I would love to get more mentorship on learning C# and XAML, but for now, I am doing everything on my own.

### Sometimes, life is hard for a panda.
